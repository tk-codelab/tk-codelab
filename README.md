### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full stack developer based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

This profile is showcasing mostly experiments, whenever I'm learning something new I might post a side project here. It's not representative of what I'm able to do (my best work is in the agency's codebase of course!)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at a digital agency
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java (& Chinese!)
- âœ¨ I'm interested in Java, Angular, Vue.js, React, Typescript, node.js, Kotlin, Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about changing your career from a creative job into a development job (as a woman!)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tk.codelab@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know how to play the ukulele!
